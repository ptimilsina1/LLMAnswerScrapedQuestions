# LLMAnswerScrapedQuestions
This script includes various steps to generate a PDF containing questions and answers retrieved from a specified URL. Here is a breakdown of the code, with some improvements and clarifications:

1. **Class Definition for PDF Generation:**
   - `PDF(FPDF)` is a custom class that extends `FPDF` to include a custom header and footer, ensuring the topic text is centered on the first page and the page number is displayed on each page.

2. **Helper Functions:**
   - `replace_non_latin_chars(text)`: This function ensures all characters are Latin-1 encoded, replacing any non-Latin characters.
   - `get_questions_from_url(url)`: This function retrieves questions from a specified URL, cleaning up the HTML content to extract questions.
   - `get_complete_answer(question, topic)`: This function generates an answer for each question using a language model (such as OpenAI's GPT). It ensures the prompt length does not exceed the model's maximum context length.
   - `write_to_pdf(filename, topic_text, questions_and_answers)`: This function writes the questions and their corresponding answers to a PDF file, properly formatting and encoding the text.

3. **Main Script Execution:**
   - Retrieves the main page content and extracts links to individual topics.
   - For each topic, retrieves the questions and generates answers.
   - Writes the questions and answers to a PDF file named based on the topic.

### Notes:
1. **Handling Non-Latin Characters:** `replace_non_latin_chars` ensures compatibility with the `FPDF` library by replacing non-Latin characters.
2. **Dynamic Topic Extraction:** The `get_questions_from_url` function dynamically extracts and cleans questions from the provided URL.
3. **Answer Generation:** The `get_complete_answer` function utilizes a language model to generate answers, ensuring the prompt length is within acceptable limits.
4. **PDF Generation:** The `write_to_pdf` function creates a well-formatted PDF document with the topic text as the header and includes page numbers in the footer.
5. **Error Handling:** Consider adding error handling for network requests and potential parsing issues.

This script efficiently automates the process of extracting, answering, and formatting questions into a PDF document.
